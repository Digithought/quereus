# Code Style Conventions

This project uses [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig) to enforce consistent coding styles across editors and IDEs.

Generally favor expressive style over imperative.  E.g. map rather than loop, conditional expressions rather than if...

Don't add superfluous comments, and be sure that comments are timeless (relative to all time, not just to changes being made).

## General Conventions
- UTF-8 encoding for all files
- Insert final newline at end of files
- Trim trailing whitespace (except in Markdown files)

## TypeScript Files
- Tab indentation (2 spaces)
- Single quotes for strings

## Markdown Files
- Space indentation
- No maximum line length enforced
- Trailing whitespace preserved (for line breaks)
- No trim trailing whitespace

## Configuration
The complete configuration is defined in [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig).
