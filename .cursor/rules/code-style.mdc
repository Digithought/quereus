# Code Style Conventions

Adhere to the single purpose principle within functions, and prefer a more expressive rather than imperative style.  `const` declarations are within the spirit of expressiveness, especially when clarifying the meaning of an expression, and of course for reuse.  Breaking sub-tasks into separate functions also makes for more self-documenting code.

Don't add superfluous comments.  Don't add comments regarding changes being made (e.g. No "// added this").

ES Modules, so always include `.js` on imports

This project uses @.editorconfig to enforce consistent coding styles across editors and IDEs.  Summary:

## TypeScript Files
- Tab indentation (2 spaces)
- Single quotes for strings

## Markdown Files
- Space indentation
- No maximum line length enforced
- Trailing whitespace preserved (for line breaks)
- No trim trailing whitespace

## Configuration
The complete configuration is defined in [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig).
