* Adhere to the single purpose principle within functions, and prefer a more expressive rather than imperative style.  `const` declarations are within the spirit of expressiveness, especially when clarifying the meaning of an expression, and of course for reuse.  Breaking sub-tasks into separate functions also makes for more self-documenting code.

* Don't add superfluous comments.  Don't add comments regarding changes being made (e.g. No "// added this").

* Prefix with `_` for unused arguments.

* Enclose `case` blocks in braces if any consts/variables introduced.

* Prefix intentional calls to unused promises (micro-tasks) with `void`.

* ES Modules, so always include `.js` on imports

* This project uses @.editorconfig to enforce consistent coding styles across editors and IDEs.  Summary: Tab indentation,  Single quotes for strings.  The complete configuration is defined in [.editorconfig](mdc:.editorconfig).
