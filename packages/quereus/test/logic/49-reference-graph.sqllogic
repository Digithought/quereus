-- Test Reference Graph and Materialization Advisory

-- Basic setup
CREATE TABLE t1 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE t2 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, t1_id INTEGER);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3);

-- Test 1: Multiple references to same subquery should trigger caching
-- The subquery (SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE value > 15) is referenced twice
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE value > 15) AS sub1) AS count1,
    (SELECT SUM(value) FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE value > 15) AS sub2) AS sum1
→ [{"count1": 2, "sum1": 50}]

-- Test 2: Nested loop join - right side should be cached
-- This tests loop context detection
SELECT t1.id, COUNT(t2.id) AS cnt
FROM t1
JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.t1_id
GROUP BY t1.id
ORDER BY t1.id
→ [{"id": 1, "cnt": 2}, {"id": 2, "cnt": 2}, {"id": 3, "cnt": 1}]

-- Test 3: Correlated subquery pattern
-- The subquery executes once per outer row
SELECT
    t1.id,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2 WHERE t2.t1_id = t1.id) AS count
FROM t1
ORDER BY t1.id
→ [{"id": 1, "count": 2}, {"id": 2, "count": 2}, {"id": 3, "count": 1}]

-- Test 4: EXISTS subquery pattern
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t1
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t2 WHERE t2.t1_id = t1.id)
→ [{"cnt": 3}]

-- Test 5: IN subquery pattern
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t1
WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT t1_id FROM t2)
→ [{"cnt": 3}]

-- Test 6: CTE with multiple references
-- The CTE is referenced twice and should be cached
WITH high_values AS (
    SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE value >= 20
)
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM high_values) AS count,
    (SELECT SUM(value) FROM high_values) AS sum
→ [{"count": 2, "sum": 50}]

-- Test 7: Complex query with multiple caching opportunities
WITH base AS (
    SELECT t1.*, COUNT(t2.id) AS ref_count
    FROM t1
    LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.t1_id
    GROUP BY t1.id, t1.value
)
SELECT
    b1.id,
    b1.ref_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM base b2 WHERE b2.ref_count > b1.ref_count) AS higher_count
FROM base b1
ORDER BY b1.id
→ [{"id": 1, "ref_count": 2, "higher_count": 0}, {"id": 2, "ref_count": 2, "higher_count": 0}, {"id": 3, "ref_count": 1, "higher_count": 2}]

-- Test 8: Non-deterministic functions should not be cached
CREATE TABLE t3 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (1), (2), (3);

-- This should not cache the random() subquery
-- Note: The result should be 3 different values due to random()
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT x) AS cnt FROM (
    SELECT (SELECT id FROM t3 ORDER BY random() LIMIT 1) AS x
    FROM t3
) sub
→ [{"cnt": 3}]
