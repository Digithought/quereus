## üîÑ Current Development Focus

**Query Optimization (Current Priority)**
- [x] **Phase 1 - Retrieve-node Infrastructure**: Complete foundation for query push-down ‚úÖ
  - [x] RetrieveNode wraps all table access 
  - [x] VirtualTableModule.supports() API for query-based modules
  - [x] VirtualTable.xExecutePlan() runtime execution
  - [x] RemoteQueryNode for physical query push-down
  - [x] Access path rule integration and test infrastructure
- [ ] **Phase 2 - Optimization Pipeline Sequencing**: Implement characteristic-based optimization phases
  - [ ] ruleGrowRetrieve: Structural sliding to maximize module query segments
  - [ ] Early predicate push-down: Cost-light optimization for better cardinality estimates  
  - [ ] Join enumeration integration: Ensure cost model benefits from push-down
- [ ] **Phase 3 - Advanced Push-down**: Complex optimization with full cost model
  - [ ] Advanced predicate push-down with sophisticated cost decisions
  - [ ] Projection and aggregation push-down optimization

**Design Philosophy: Characteristic-Based Rules**
- Rules target logical node characteristics rather than hard-coded node types
- RetrieveNode is the principled exception (represents unique module boundary concept)
- Phase sequencing ensures each optimization stage has proper cost information
- Structural phases (grow-retrieve) precede cost-dependent phases (complex push-down)

**Core SQL Features (Lower Priority)**
- [ ] **DELETE T FROM ...**: Allow specification of target alias for DML ops
- [ ] **Orthogonal relational expressions**: allow any expression that results in a relational expression in a relational expressive context 
- [ ] Values in "select" locations (e.g. views)
- [ ] Expression-based functions
- [ ] Make "on conflict" an argument of xUpdate, rather than _onConflict row voodoo:
```ts
				(newRow as any)._onConflict = plan.onConflict || 'abort';
				await vtab.xUpdate!('insert', newRow);
```
- [ ] Fix suppressed constant folding issue (see Known Issues in optimizer.md)
- [ ] Complete constraint extraction implementation (currently has placeholder logic)
- [ ] More intelligent key inference for joins and beyond
- [ ] Make choice of scheduler run method determined at constructor time, not in run

**Window Functions (Remaining)**
- [ ] **LAG/LEAD**: Offset functions
- [ ] **FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE**: Navigation functions  
- [ ] **RANGE BETWEEN**: Range-based window frames
- [ ] **PERCENT_RANK/CUME_DIST**: Statistical ranking functions

**Type Coercion Enhancements**
- [ ] **ORDER BY**: Enhanced numeric sorting of string columns using coercion

## üìã Future Development Areas

**Optimizer Enhancements (Near-term)**
- [ ] **Advanced Statistics**: Move beyond naive heuristics to VTab-supplied or ANALYZE-based stats
- [ ] **Sophisticated Cost Models**: Better formulas for complex operations and join algorithms  
- [ ] **Plan Validation**: Runtime tree validation to catch optimizer bugs early
- [ ] **Execution Metrics**: Row-level telemetry for verifying cardinality estimates

**Schema & DDL Enhancements**
- [ ] **Foreign Key Constraints**: REFERENCES constraints with cascading actions
- [ ] **Computed Columns**: Columns with derived values
- [ ] **ALTER TABLE**: More comprehensive ALTER TABLE operations
- [ ] **Materialized Views**: Views with cached results

**Performance & Scalability (Medium-term)**
- [ ] **Memory Pooling**: Reduce allocation overhead in hot paths
- [ ] **Query Caching**: Result caching and invalidation strategies
- [ ] **Streaming Execution**: Better streaming support for large result sets
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded query execution for CPU-bound operations

**Developer Experience & Tooling**
- [ ] **Enhanced EXPLAIN**: More detailed query plan analysis capabilities
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Detailed execution timing and resource usage
- [ ] **Virtual Table Development Guide**: Best practices for creating custom vtab modules

**Testing & Quality (Ongoing)**
- [ ] **Stress Testing**: Large dataset and concurrent operation testing
- [ ] **Fuzzing**: Automated testing with random SQL generation
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Regression testing for performance
- [ ] **Cross-platform Testing**: Browser, Node.js, React Native environments

**Advanced Features (Long-term Vision)**
- [ ] **Real-time Queries**: Streaming query execution over live data
- [ ] **Graph Queries**: Graph traversal and pattern matching capabilities
- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration**: Built-in ML functions and operators

**Ecosystem Integration**
- [ ] **Database Connectors**: Interfaces to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.
- [ ] **ORM Adapters**: Integration with TypeScript/JavaScript ORMs
- [ ] **Cloud Platform**: Cloud-native deployment and scaling options
- [ ] **Data Pipeline Integration**: Standard connectors for ETL workflows

### Push-down & Federation Roadmap

**Phase 1 ‚Äì Retrieve-node Infrastructure** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Introduce `RetrieveNode` (unary, wraps every `TableReference` at build time)
- ‚úÖ `ModuleCapabilityAPI.supports()` returns `{cost, ctx}`; cost used versus local plan
- ‚úÖ Update `ruleSelectAccessPath` for RemoteQueryNode vs Scan/Seek
- ‚úÖ `VirtualTable.xExecutePlan()` method for query-based push-down execution
- ‚úÖ Test module infrastructure for validating query-based push-down

**Phase 2 ‚Äì Optimization Pipeline Sequencing**
- [ ] **ruleGrowRetrieve** (structural phase): Bottom-up sliding to maximize module-supported query segments
  - [ ] Walk plan bottom-up, test `supports(candidatePipeline)` for each RetrieveNode
  - [ ] Slide RetrieveNode upward when module supports expanded pipeline
  - [ ] Stop sliding when `supports()` returns undefined (capability boundary reached)
  - [ ] Result: Fixed, maximum "query segments" for all base relations
- [ ] **Early Predicate Push-down** (cost-light phase): Push obviously beneficial predicates
  - [ ] Target simple filter characteristics (constants, key equality, LIMIT 1)
  - [ ] Purpose: Improve cardinality estimates before join enumeration
  - [ ] Only push predicates that modules explicitly support
- [ ] **Join Enumeration Integration**: Ensure join rewriting uses realistic cardinality estimates
  - [ ] Verify join cost model accounts for pushed-down predicates
  - [ ] Test that join enumeration benefits from phase 1-2 optimizations

**Phase 3 ‚Äì Advanced Push-down Optimization**
- [ ] **Advanced Predicate Push-down** (cost-precise phase): Complex predicate optimization
  - [ ] OR-predicate factorisation and split across children
  - [ ] `IN (‚Ä¶)`, `BETWEEN`, NULL test optimizations
  - [ ] Subquery predicate push-down with correlation analysis
- [ ] **Projection Push-down**: Eliminate unnecessary column retrieval
  - [ ] Project only required attributes through module boundary
  - [ ] Coordinate with SELECT list requirements and JOIN dependencies
- [ ] **Aggregation Push-down**: Push GROUP BY and aggregate functions
  - [ ] Simple aggregates (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX) for supported modules
  - [ ] Complex aggregation split strategies
