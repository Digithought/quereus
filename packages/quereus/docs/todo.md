**Legend:**
- `[ ]`: Not Started
- `[P]`: Partially Implemented / In Progress  
- `[X]`: Completed âœ…

**Next Phase Focus:** The primary development focus should shift from implementing missing core SQL features (which are now largely complete) to **optimization, performance, and advanced features**. The engine has a solid foundation and can handle complex SQL workloads effectively.
