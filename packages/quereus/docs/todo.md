## Project TODO List & Future Work

This list reflects the **current state** of Quereus - a feature-complete SQL query processor with a modern Titan optimizer architecture. The core infrastructure is solid and most foundational work is complete!

## üèóÔ∏è Titan Optimizer Implementation Progress

### Completed Phases
- ‚úÖ **Phase 0 - Groundwork**: Cost models, constraint analysis, shared caching utilities, development standards
- ‚úÖ **xBestIndex Refactor**: Modern type-safe BestAccessPlan API replacing legacy SQLite-style interfaces  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 - Core Framework**: Rule registration, trace framework, physical properties, statistics abstraction, emitter metadata, golden plan tests
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2 - Cache & Visualize**: Intelligent materialization advisory, async stream utilities, PlanViz CLI tool
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2.5 - Generic Tree Rewriting**: Abstract `withChildren()` method for robust tree transformations with attribute ID preservation
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3 - Constant Folding**: Functional safety flags, runtime-based evaluation, expression boundary optimization

### In Progress
- üîÑ **Phase 1.5 - Access Path Selection**: Seek/range scan infrastructure and optimization rules

### Upcoming Optimizer Work
- üìã **Predicate Pushdown**: Push filter predicates closer to data sources
- üìã **Subquery Optimization**: Transform correlated subqueries to joins
- üìã **Advanced Statistics**: VTab-supplied or ANALYZE-based statistics
- üìã **Join Algorithms**: Hash joins and merge joins
- üìã **Aggregate Pushdown**: Push aggregations below joins when semantically valid
- üìã **Key-driven row-count reduction**: With better key inference, cardinality can be better estimated and efficiencies gained


## üîÑ Current Development Focus

**Cleanup**
- [ ] try to remove most dynamic attribute references between classes/objects (fragile assumptions)
- [ ] switch from casting to using "satisfies" in as many places as possible

**Core SQL Features**
- [ ] **DELETE T FROM ...**: Allow specification of target alias for DML ops
- [ ] **Orthogonal relational expressions**: allow any expression that results in a relational expression in a relational expressive context 
- [ ] Default nullability to `not null` and document
- [ ] Values in "select" locations (e.g. views)
- [ ] Expression-based functions
- [ ] Make "on conflict" an argument of xUpdate, rather than _onConflict row voodoo:
```ts
				(newRow as any)._onConflict = plan.onConflict || 'abort';
				await vtab.xUpdate!('insert', newRow);
```
- [ ] Fix suppressed constant folding issue (see Known Issues in optimizer.md)
- [ ] Complete constraint extraction implementation (currently has placeholder logic)
- [ ] More intelligent key inference for joins and beyond
- [ ] Make choice of scheduler run method determined at constructor time, not in run

**Query Optimization (Next Priority)**
- [ ] **Phase 1.5 - Access Path Selection**: Complete `SeqScanNode`, `IndexScanNode`, `IndexSeekNode` implementation (currently partial with fallbacks)
- [ ] **QuickPick Join Optimization**: Implement TSP-inspired join ordering using random greedy tours
  - [ ] Phase 2: Multi-pass optimizer framework
  - [ ] Phase 3: Join cardinality cost model  
  - [ ] Phase 4: Random tour generator with configurable count
  - [ ] Phase 5: Best plan selection and integration
- [ ] **Predicate Pushdown**: Advanced filter predicate optimization closer to data sources
- [ ] **Subquery Optimization**: Transform correlated subqueries to joins where beneficial

**Window Functions (Remaining)**
- [ ] **LAG/LEAD**: Offset functions
- [ ] **FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE**: Navigation functions  
- [ ] **RANGE BETWEEN**: Range-based window frames
- [ ] **PERCENT_RANK/CUME_DIST**: Statistical ranking functions

**Type Coercion Enhancements**
- [ ] **ORDER BY**: Enhanced numeric sorting of string columns using coercion

## üìã Future Development Areas

**Optimizer Enhancements (Near-term)**
- [ ] **Advanced Statistics**: Move beyond naive heuristics to VTab-supplied or ANALYZE-based stats
- [ ] **Sophisticated Cost Models**: Better formulas for complex operations and join algorithms  
- [ ] **Plan Validation**: Runtime tree validation to catch optimizer bugs early
- [ ] **Execution Metrics**: Row-level telemetry for verifying cardinality estimates

**Schema & DDL Enhancements**
- [ ] **Foreign Key Constraints**: REFERENCES constraints with cascading actions
- [ ] **Computed Columns**: Columns with derived values
- [ ] **ALTER TABLE**: More comprehensive ALTER TABLE operations
- [ ] **Materialized Views**: Views with cached results

**Performance & Scalability (Medium-term)**
- [ ] **Memory Pooling**: Reduce allocation overhead in hot paths
- [ ] **Query Caching**: Result caching and invalidation strategies
- [ ] **Streaming Execution**: Better streaming support for large result sets
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded query execution for CPU-bound operations

**Developer Experience & Tooling**
- [ ] **Enhanced EXPLAIN**: More detailed query plan analysis capabilities
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Detailed execution timing and resource usage
- [ ] **ESLint Rules**: Prevent physical nodes in builder code, enforce conventions
- [ ] **Virtual Table Development Guide**: Best practices for creating custom vtab modules

**Testing & Quality (Ongoing)**
- [ ] **Stress Testing**: Large dataset and concurrent operation testing
- [ ] **Fuzzing**: Automated testing with random SQL generation
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Regression testing for performance
- [ ] **Cross-platform Testing**: Browser, Node.js, React Native environments

**Advanced Features (Long-term Vision)**
- [ ] **Distributed Queries**: Query federation across multiple data sources
- [ ] **Real-time Queries**: Streaming query execution over live data
- [ ] **Graph Queries**: Graph traversal and pattern matching capabilities
- [ ] **Machine Learning Integration**: Built-in ML functions and operators

**Ecosystem Integration**
- [ ] **Database Connectors**: Interfaces to PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.
- [ ] **ORM Adapters**: Integration with TypeScript/JavaScript ORMs
- [ ] **Cloud Platform**: Cloud-native deployment and scaling options
- [ ] **Data Pipeline Integration**: Standard connectors for ETL workflows
