## General Conventions

- Use lowercase SQL reserved words for readability (e.g., `select * from Table`)
- Don't use inline `import()` unless dynamically loading
- Don't create summary documents; update existing documentation
- Stay DRY; If you see code that isn't DRY, refactor and abstract.
- No lengthy summaries
- Don't worry about backwards compatibility yet.
- Use yarn
- No half-baked janky parsers; use a full-fledged parser or better, brainstorm with the dev for another way

Start with packages/quereus/README.md to come up to speed, then read and maintain these and other docs (in docs/) along with the work.
