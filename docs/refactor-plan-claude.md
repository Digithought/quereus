Based on examining the codebase, here are key strategies to improve Quereus's architecture and development process:

## Architectural Improvements

1. **Move to pipeline stages with immutable inputs/outputs**
   - Replace the monolithic compiler with smaller pipeline stages that pass immutable data structures
   - Each stage should perform a specific transformation (AST→IR→Plan→Bytecode)
   - Make intermediate representations serializable for debugging

2. **Decouple state management from logic**
   - Extract core compilation logic from state management 
   - Create dedicated context objects passed explicitly between functions
   - Replace direct mutation with pure functions that return new state

3. **Implement a proper intermediate representation**
   - Create a formal IR between AST and bytecode
   - Make the IR easier to optimize, reason about, and debug than direct bytecode

4. **Add comprehensive instrumentation**
   - Create query plan visualization tooling
   - Add compiler state snapshots at key points
   - Improve logging to focus on state transitions, not just operations

## Development Process Changes

1. **Incremental refactoring approach**
   - Start with high-value, isolated components (expression compiler, planner)
   - Add strong interfaces between components before refactoring internals
   - Use the adapter pattern to bridge old and new implementations

2. **Improved testing strategy**
   - Test each transformer in isolation with snapshot testing
   - Compare execution plans between old and new implementations
   - Create regression suites for fixed bugs

3. **Create a development REPL/playground**
   - Build tools to inspect intermediate compilation artifacts
   - Add an interactive mode to try queries and see each compilation stage
   - Visualize the transformations from SQL→AST→IR→Plan→Bytecode→Results

4. **Implement better error design**
   - Create domain-specific error types for each layer
   - Add context-aware error messages with suggestions
   - Include relevant state in error objects for debugging

These approaches will progressively transform the codebase into something more maintainable without requiring a complete rewrite.
