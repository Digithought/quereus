## Architecture

*Details to be filled out during planning phase.*

Ongoing quality work:
- Stress testing with large datasets and concurrency
- Fuzzing with random SQL generation
- Performance benchmarks for regression testing
- Cross-platform testing (browser, Node.js, React Native)

**Principles:** SPP, DRY, modular architecture. Automated quality gates.

## TODO
