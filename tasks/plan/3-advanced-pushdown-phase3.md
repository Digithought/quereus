description: Phase 3 Advanced Push-down with full cost model
dependencies: Titan optimizer phases 1-2, cost model
priority: 3

## Architecture

*Details to be filled out during planning phase.*

Advanced optimization with sophisticated cost decisions:
- LIKE prefix optimization
- Complex OR factoring
- Dynamic constraints (plan-time shape, runtime binding evaluation)
- Range seeks with dynamic bounds
- IN list strategy selection (seek-union vs residual)
- Projection and aggregation push-down

**Principles:** SPP, DRY, modular architecture. Cost-based decisions throughout.

## TODO

### Phase 1: Planning
- [ ] Design cost model extensions
- [ ] Plan dynamic constraint infrastructure

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Implement advanced predicate optimizations
- [ ] Add range seek support
- [ ] Implement projection push-down

### Phase 3: Review & Test
- [ ] Review optimization correctness
- [ ] Benchmark performance improvements
