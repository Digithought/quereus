description: Optimizer enhancements (cost models, plan validation, metrics)
dependencies: Titan optimizer core

## Architecture

*Details to be filled out during planning phase.*

Near-term optimizer enhancements:
- Advanced statistics beyond naive heuristics
- Sophisticated cost models for complex operations
- Plan validation for catching optimizer bugs
- Execution metrics for cardinality verification

**Principles:** SPP, DRY, modular architecture. Observable optimization process.

## TODO

### Phase 1: Planning
- [ ] Prioritize enhancements
- [ ] Design each feature

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Implement incrementally

### Phase 3: Review & Test
- [ ] Review effectiveness
- [ ] Test optimizer correctness
