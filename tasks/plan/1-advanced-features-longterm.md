## Architecture

*Details to be filled out during planning phase.*

Long-term vision:
- Real-time queries with streaming execution
- Graph queries with traversal and pattern matching
- Machine learning integration with built-in functions

**Principles:** SPP, DRY, modular architecture. Research-driven design.

## TODO

### Phase 1: Planning
- [ ] Research approaches
- [ ] Design feasibility studies

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Prototype and iterate

### Phase 3: Review & Test
- [ ] Review viability
- [ ] Test prototypes
