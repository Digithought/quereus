# Master Orchestration — Review Completion Summary

The master orchestration plan tracked the execution order, dependencies, and coordination of all code review tasks across the Quereus project. This document records the final state at the time the orchestration task was closed.

## Completed Reviews (15)

### Phase 1: Foundation — ALL COMPLETE
- [x] Types Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-types.md`)
- [x] Utilities Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-utilities.md`)
- [x] Schema Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-schema.md`)

### Phase 2: Core Pipeline — ALL COMPLETE
- [x] Parser Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-parser.md`)
- [x] Planner Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-planner.md`)
- [x] Optimizer Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-optimizer.md`)
- [x] Runtime Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-runtime.md`)

### Phase 3: Data Layer — ALL COMPLETE
- [x] VTab Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-vtab.md`)
- [x] Functions Review (`tasks/complete/3-core-functions-review.md`)

### Phase 4: API & Integration — ALL COMPLETE
- [x] Core API Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-core-api.md`)
- [x] Integration Boundaries Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-integration-boundaries.md`)

### Phase 5: Packages — PARTIAL (3 of 11)
- [x] Plugin Loader Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-pkg-plugin-loader.md`)
- [x] Plugins Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-pkg-plugins.md`)
- [x] Sample Plugins Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-pkg-sample-plugins.md`)

### Phase 6: Cross-Cutting — PARTIAL (2 of 4)
- [x] Documentation Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-documentation.md`)
- [x] Error Handling Review (`tasks/complete/3-review-error-handling.md`)

## Remaining Reviews (10) — still in tasks/review/

### Phase 5: Packages
- [ ] Store Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-store.md`)
- [ ] Sync Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-sync.md`)
- [ ] Sync Client Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-sync-client.md`)
- [ ] Sync Coordinator Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-sync-coordinator.md`)
- [ ] Quoomb Web Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-quoomb-web.md`)
- [ ] VS Code Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-vscode.md`)
- [ ] Tools Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-tools.md`)
- [ ] Isolation Review (`tasks/review/3-review-pkg-isolation.md`)

### Phase 6: Cross-Cutting
- [ ] Testing Strategy Review (`tasks/review/3-review-testing-strategy.md`)
- [ ] Performance Review (`tasks/review/3-review-performance.md`)

## Observations

- All core subsystem reviews (Phases 1–4) completed successfully. The core engine — parser, planner, optimizer, runtime, schema, types, vtab, functions, API, and integration boundaries — has been fully reviewed.
- The plugin system (loader, plugins, sample plugins) is reviewed; the remaining package reviews cover storage, sync, applications, and tooling.
- Each remaining review is independently tracked as its own task file in `tasks/review/` and can proceed without further orchestration.
- Dependency ordering from the original plan was largely respected: foundation → core pipeline → data layer → API → packages → cross-cutting.

## Testing & Validation

This was a tracking/orchestration document, not a code module. No unit tests apply. Validation consisted of verifying the file-system state of `tasks/complete/` and `tasks/review/` against the progress claims.
